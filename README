description: Our project is a civilization simulator.  It creates a map and populates the map with AI players.  The AI players then expand their civilizations and send out armies to conquer others.  The simulator will run for a specified amount of time and then terminate.  Many parameters for map generation and the simulation will be set in a configuration file.  Furthurmore, each section of the simulator will be programed in c++ but will use a python or bash script to tie of of the parts together.  The program will leverage heavily on already existing linux code and commands.  Lastly, the program is designed in a highly modular fashion.  These facts fit well with the UNIX philosophy.

// How to use guide:
// Dependencies:
// You will need to install ncurses library to compile this game.
// Ubuntu: $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
// Fedora: $ sudo yum install ncurses-devel.x86_64 
// Compiling:
// To compile run $ make clean
// and then $ make
// Starting the program:
// To run program, use the shell script.
// Uses the command $ ./simulator.sh.
// You can modify the script to change some parameters.
// Changing mapfile will change where the map itself is stored.
// Changing x or y will determine how large of map is generated.
// X is the number of columns, Y is the number of rows
// Configuration options:
// For the simulation options, you can change how many turns there
// are per simulation by changing turns. 
// You can change how many armies each player can have by changing
// maximum_armies. The number of cities each player can have is changed
// by cities_per_player. The colors of player1 and player2 may also be
// changed by modifying the player1_color and player2_color lines.
// However, the color code must come from one of the colors listed
// under display parameters (0-7). You must also keep the single 
// quotes intact or the program will not properly scan the config file.
// The Simulator:
// If you follow all the instructions, you are probably wondering what
// is taking place. There are two players in the simulator each one
// assigned a color. The config file determines how many cities each
// player has, and essentially, little 'C' characters appear around
// the map (not on blue/ocean tiles) which represent the cities. It
// is then that roads represented by 'R' and armies represented by 
// 'U' are created. Roads are connected adjacently (up/down/left/right,
// not diagonal) to the cities and to other roads. Armies move around
// the map one space at a time and then take over (change the color to
// their player's color) cities, and other roads. Armies of opposing
// players will fight when they are adjacent to one and another, and 
// will potentially destroy the other unit. Armies that are on roads
// and cities will "cover-up" the space. The simulation is over
// after a set number of turns that can be changed in the config file.
