description: Our project is a civilization simulator.  It creates a map and populates the map with AI players.  The AI players then expand their civilizations and send out armies to conquer others.  The simulator will run for a specified amount of time and then terminate.  Many parameters for map generation and the simulation will be set in a configuration file.  Furthurmore, each section of the simulator will be programed in c++ but will use a python or bash script to tie of of the parts together.  The program will leverage heavily on already existing linux code and commands.  Lastly, the program is designed in a highly modular fashion.  These facts fit well with the UNIX philosophy.

// How to use guide:
// Dependencies:
// You will need to install ncurses library to compile this game.
// Linux: $ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev
// Compiling:
// To compile run $ make clean
// and then $ make
// Starting the program:
// To run program, use the shell script.
// Uses the command $ ./simulator.sh.
// You can modify the script to change some parameters.
// Changing mapfile will change where the map itself is stored.
// Changing x or y will determine how large of map is generated.
// Configuration options:
// For the simulation options, you can change how many turns there
// are per simulation by changing turns. 
// You can change how many armies each player can have by changing
// maximum_armies. The number of cities each player can have is changed
// by cities_per_player. The colors of player1 and player2 may also be
// changed by modifying the player1_color and player2_color lines.
// However, the color code must come from one of the colors listed
// under display parameters (30-37). You must also keep the single 
// quotes intact or the program will not properly scan the config file.
