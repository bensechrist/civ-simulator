description: Our project is a civilization simulator.  It creates a map and populates the map with AI players.  The AI players then expand their civilizations and send out armies to conquer others.  The simulator will run for a specified amount of time and then terminate.  Many parameters for map generation and the simulation will be set in a configuration file.  Furthurmore, each section of the simulator will be programed in c++ but will use a python or bash script to tie of of the parts together.  The program will leverage heavily on already existing linux code and commands.  Lastly, th program is designed in a highly modular fashion.  These facts fit well with the UNIX philosophy.
